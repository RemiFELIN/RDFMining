----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper describes a method for scoring axioms based on how "possible" they are, as opposed to how probable. The intuition is that an axiom is possible to the degree that facts in the knowledge base support and do not contradict its entailments. Since the absence of supporting facts does not detract from possibility (a formula is maximally possible if there are no counterexamples), the measure respects the open-world assumption. This also means that scoring can be very expensive, especially for questionable axioms. The authors, therefore implemented a dynamic timeout based on a time predictor.

The authors present a useful alternative to axiom scoring. Considering informative support and counterexamples (and avoiding the closed-world assumption) is a good contribution. But the more compelling contribution is figuring out how to do this (relatively) inexpensively. The observation that the scoring is most expensive for those formulas that ultimately end up being rejected allows them to be avoided (and assumed rejected) without too much damage from false negatives. Of course, this is dependent on finding an efficient way to predict whether scoring will be expensive for a particular formula, which the authors have found.

Although I am not overly familiar with this area, these contributions seem quite valuable to me. I would have appreciated a more thorough comparison to probability-based scores. Figure 1 compares the formulas accepted by the possibilistic score vs. a probabilistic score, but it seems only to show that the possibilistic score accepts more formulas than the probabilistic one. The text suggests that accuracy is also better, but I didn't see the experimental results confirming that. Furthermore, the acceptance thresholds for each seem arbitrary. Are these really comparable.

The paper is clear and well written, with the minor annoyance of "heuristics" being plural everywhere, even with singular determiners.

----------- REVIEW -----------
This paper presents a method to score ontology axioms, on the basis of the way they are either contradicted or confirmed by the data - using a possibilistic framework. This is certainly an interesting approach, and the method employed seems sensible. The paper is actually more precisely about time-capping the (rather time consuming) process, on the hypothesis that there is an inverse correlation between time and score, meaning that only badly scored axioms would be missed through time-capping. The results are evaluation on subclass axiom in DBpedia.

However, this paper is very hard to evaluate for several reasons. First, I am not an expert on many of the elements mentioned in the paper, and the paper is quite hard to read (with several notions not being introduced). Also, this is an incremental work, taking reference [17] as a basis and adding, apparently, the evaluation of time-capping. It seems a small increment from my point of view, and since reference [17] was obfuscated, the exact additional contribution of this paper cannot really be verified. 

There are also many general claims made in the paper that have no basis: "It is common practice..." - what evidence do you have of that? "We argue that such a probability-based framework is not satisfactory." - that's not an argument, it is a claim with no basis. 

Finally, there is no real reference to compare to in the evaluation so it is hard to tell whether the results are good or not.

----------- REVIEW -----------
In this	paper, the authors propose a framework for axiom scoring based on possibility theory and evaluated on subsumtion axioms ie., subClassOf relations in DBpedia database.
Considering the	amount of time it takes	to test	each axiom using the proposed model, the authors additionally propose a variant to greatly reduce the amount of time by setting a dynamic time-out on the axiom at test.
The authors combine possibility	measure	and necessity measure of an axiom to define a single metric, Acceptance/rejection index(ARI) to test the validity of a given axiom.

This paper is a minor extension to "Testing OWL Axioms against RDF Facts: A Possibilistic Approach" and most of the work proposed in the paper is almost same.
This paper adds	two additional capabilities 1) Time capping the	axiom validation for the possibilistic approach	and 2) combine probabilistic and possibilistic approach reducing the error rate.

Considering limited contributions of the paper compared	to the existing literature, it would be nice if the authors extend the paper to other types of axioms.
