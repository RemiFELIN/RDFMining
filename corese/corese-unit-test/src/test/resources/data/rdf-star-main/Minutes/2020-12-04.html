<p class='phone'>
<cite>pavel:</cite> i looked, seems fine
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>Olaf:</cite> let's keep it on the agenda for the next time
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> let's add tests for it, even if they don't pass yet
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>Olaf:</cite> shall we split the tests on query answering and parsing?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> there're subsets already
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>Olaf:</cite> it's parsing vs execution, not answering

<h3 id="item02">Continue discussing the tests cases in the proposed semantics test-suite</h3>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; <a href="https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/tests/semantics/manifest.html#all-identical-embedded-triples-are-the-same">https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/tests/semantics/manifest.html#all-identical-embedded-triples-are-the-same</a>
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> last time we stopped there ^^ <br>
... at the moment this is how the definitions in the Olaf's paper define RDF* <br>
... and also how it's implemented right now <br>
... embedded triples are one and the same thing as long as all SPO components are the same <br>
... there was a concern about that (in the mailing list) <br>
... could make it difficult to address some use cases, eg. Wikidata <br>
... where we need to represent diff occurrences of the same statement <br>
... since same statement can be said by different people and then they could be different <br>
... some PG databases can have multi-edges and different attributes <br>
... it's a known limitation, my position is these complicate things (though not impossible)
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; It's not just the Wikidata use case.  The examples related to provenance point to having multiple embedded triples with the same s,p,o.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> extending RDF* to more complex examples would require to distinguish occurrences of the same triple
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> are 2 triples in different NGs, are they the same?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> yeah
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; And it's not just the provenance examples - belief is another place where one might want to distinguish between different embedded triples with the same s,p.o.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> if a triple exists in multiple NGs, does it exist only in the NG where it's stated?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> the meaning of the named graph isn't formalised <br>
... so it's not easy
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> Wikidata semantics could be resolved ins ome interpretation of named graphs, no? <br>
... at least it'd make sense to me <br>
... it should allow you to speak differently depending on named graph
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> do we speak about triples as extensions or occurrences in graphs/document? i tried to discuss that in my long email
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; I don't see how named graphs help in expressing Wikidata.  WIkidata has one "ground" but that ground can have multiple statements with the same s,p.o.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> if 2 people want to say different things about the same triple, you have to differentiate in the semantics <br>
... but defining semantics about all triples of the same type(?) makes it impossible
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> 2 embedde triples in 2 NGs represents the same thing <br>
... but: i can describe some thing in a NG, e.g. rdf-star a :great-idea and in a different graph rdf-star a :broken <br>
... i can do that, and the triple is still the same <br>
... if someone merges the graphs then we get a contradiction. but they don't have to merge those graphs
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> i'd be interested in how it works
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> what we should try is enabling the basic building blocks are there to solve use cases <br>
... it might need something else <br>
... you could have RDF* triples as defined in the papers and be able to make statements <br>
... statings vs statements (the former being the action of making the statement) <br>
... the triple term right now can be annotated itself
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> if we enable basic blocks then RDF reification works
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> nope? <br>
... agree with pfps that many UCs can be solved with reification <br>
... but it's more on users than us
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> evidence that we have that users use RDF, ie those documents, and as i pointed out, those documents are in bad shape <br>
... either someone needs to fix them up and provide good evidence
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> there's absemce of evidence for the use of RDF reification <br>
... i want to get to a point where we can make progress without boiling the ocean
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Jerven do you want to say anything about reification
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>jerven:</cite> yes. reification solves our problem (to talk about the triple) <br>
... i.e. talking about a relationship, it works fine as-is. <br>
... but it's soo ugly <br>
... and blows up data <br>
... and queries! <br>
... lots of joins too. that's problematic on large scale data. <br>
... semantics is fine. but join performance and verbosity are problematic
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; I wonder whether embedded triples would help at all in SPARQL performance.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>thomas</cite>&gt; so RDF* with the RDF reification semantics would be fine for you, Jerven?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> want to add what RDF* buys us re: reification, it adds atomicity
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>jerven:</cite> we'd like to have that
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; It would be nice to have some experiments on how fast SPARQL* queries are over embedded triples.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>jerven:</cite> then the question is: do we constraint the rdf reification to say that your RDF reification graphs must be complete <br>
... if you want RDF* enabled, you cannot have invalid/incomplete reification statements <br>
... at some point semantics faces the practicality issue
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>blake:</cite> to respond re: reification verbosity <br>
... i don't think any of those issues are necessarily <br>
... those can be implementation details <br>
... stores can have special treatments for RDF reification triples <br>
... constraints can be enforced <br>
... performance gains with RDF* are not a given
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Olaf</cite>&gt; Blake, Jena did have such special treatment but they took it out
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; +1 to blake
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> there was some experience with that <br>
... experience wasn't very good <br>
... first problem is partials <br>
... a lot of low-level work needed to deal with reification <br>
... maybe it's not such a big issues these days since hardware is better
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; scribe: pchampin
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; And what is the burden of implementing triples as a new node type?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pavel:</cite> in theory, it is true that performance issues of reification can be optimized away, <br>
... but in practice, it proved very hard <br>
... It is difficult to not leak those ugly reification triples to the user.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; Work by Kevin Wilkinson and others: <a href="https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~ifc/SWDB/papers/Wilkinson_etal.pdf">https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~ifc/SWDB/papers/Wilkinson_etal.pdf</a>
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>scribe</cite>&gt; scribe: pavel
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> i don't know anyone saying that we should keep the standard reification. but its semantics is fine. <br>
... i think we should keep that semantics, if RDF* would conform that'd be great
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> the syntax of Turtle* and SPARQL* would make it hard <br>
... one could imagine that every occurrence in &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; identifies a new occurrence.. <br>
... but it'd make it very complex <br>
... lots of practical issues will arise
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> by default i'd suggest that an annotation refers to the triple in the same named graph (?) <br>
... others may have totally different opinions
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> so you'd not object to the test as written?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> no idea :)
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> ok, we need to make progress in one way or another <br>
... but the more we agree on, the better
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>blake:</cite> re: reification, it sounds like everyone is not against RDF* being syntactic sugar <br>
... maybe with a better syntax and query patterns
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; +1 for blake's comment that implementing embedded triples is hard too
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; [] rdf:subject :a, :b.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>blake:</cite> all the points re: implementation, they're muted because the same would be required when embedded statements are first-class citizens <br>
... so we can get away with syntactic sugar
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>jerven:</cite> in Uniprot we generate statement IDs which aren't quite valid in RDF/XML, so each statement gets an ID when we reify it <br>
... and that works fine <br>
... so we never have to generate reification quads again
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Zakim</cite>&gt; AndyS, you wanted to suggest a strawpoll
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>jerven:</cite> i feel RDF* should be compatible with reification but we don't have to require it being as expressive
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> what does everyone think?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> same idea
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; +1 to Jerven
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> still don't know what RDF* is supposed to be good for. how can i approve any test then?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>thomas</cite>&gt; +1 to Jerven
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> agree, good question. strawpoll here
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; STRAWPOLL: would you be happy with RDF* being syntactic sugar for standard reification (possibly with more constraints)?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>blake</cite>&gt; +1
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>thomas</cite>&gt; +1
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>jerven</cite>&gt; +1
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; +1

&lt;<cite>gkellogg</cite>&gt; -0

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; -0

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; +1 "with more constraints"
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>james</cite>&gt; +0
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>jerven</cite>&gt; +1  "with more constraints"
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Doerthe</cite>&gt; -0
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Olaf</cite>&gt; Do you mean in terms of semantics?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
0 (cannot answer)
</p>

<p class='phone'>
+1 to AndyS!
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; There are lots of sins that can be covered by syntactic sugar.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> it depends on what we mean by syntactic sugar (and pavel agrees)
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Olaf</cite>&gt; +1
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> i mean that Turtle* docs can be rewritten into reification and that'd make no difference
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>thomas</cite>&gt; I interpreted "syntactic sugar for RDF reofication" as keeping the RDF refication semantics
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; scribe: pchampin
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pavel:</cite> I couldn't answer the strawpoll.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; I'm generally in favour of the syntactic sugar solution, particularly as it allows for other kinds of reification.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pavel:</cite> should the system return the reification triples? that would not be good
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pavel</cite>&gt; scribe: pavel
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>blake:</cite> sugar should not disallow synthetic URIs or triples
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; But the problem is if you have mixed syntax - some [[...]] and some rdf:subject.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>blake:</cite> that could be another form of syntactic sugar?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
+1 to pfps
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> this needs to be explored, let's see if we have a ticket on it. but there seems to be no strong opposition so it's a serious option
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; But there is no gain without pain, and it is completely unclear to me as to even the magnitude of the pains for the various approaches.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> but not there are some different expectations from syntactic sugar <br>
... gotta think till next week <br>
... thanks everyone, no formal decision for now, but feels like progress nonetheless <br>
... bye
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; One pain would be to allow embedded triples to be incomplete and transform rdf:subject etc into embedded triples.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>jerven</cite>&gt; Thank you all.
