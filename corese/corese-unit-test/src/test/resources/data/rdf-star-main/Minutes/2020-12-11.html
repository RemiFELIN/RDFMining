<cite>ora:</cite> I’m a member of the Amazon graph DB team. Ora Lassa.

&lt;<cite>ora</cite>&gt; Correct spelling: Ora Lassila
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>TallTed:</cite> I’m with OpenLink Software, maker of Virtuoso and many other things, and I've been on many W3 groups since about 2000.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>olaf</cite>&gt; Welcome Ora and Ted!!
</p>

<h3 id="item03">open actions</h3>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; <a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaction">https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaction</a>
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Two actions, one about creating a test suite. Andy has created Turtle* syntax tests. <br>
... I’ve created a skelleton for SPARQL* <br>
... I think we can close the action, although the test suites aren’t (and may never by) complete. <br>
... I’d like to suggest … The tests are very abstract, and based on my understanding on RDF*. <br>
... pfps has suggested that it may be premature. <br>
... I’d like to ask people that have run the test cases to translate examples into test cases. <br>
... It may help to make a link from practical issues without loosing track of what people have proposed.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pavel</cite>&gt; SPARQL* test cases?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>gatemezing</cite>&gt; Is there a way to map those UCs using the manifest file?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; scribe: pchampin
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> syntax tests are not about interpretation <br>
... we need to set a line where N-Triple* is, so that we can write syntax tests with their *meaning* <br>
... I'm concern that people think that annotations and pointy brackets are different things
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>gkellogg</cite>&gt; AndyS: I put some notes in the annotation discussion about that. N-Triples* is a key to understanding this.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>scribe</cite>&gt; scribe: gkellogg
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER:</cite> Jos’ EYE has been reporting trnslations, and I’d like to create evaluation tests based on those.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Jerven</cite>&gt; (sorry I am late and can only stay a bit)
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> I agree with the need for N-Triples*, and things are held up on that.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>TallTed:</cite> I’m seeing a lot of bluring in whats being discussed to date. I’ve been out of date for the last year.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; AndyS: Offer to write some evaluation tests starting with the EYE translation.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>TallTed:</cite> Much of what’s been discussed is focusing on Quads and not talking about N-Triples. The “Star” has got to go. If it’s an evolution of RDF it needs to be treated as such. <br>
... We can’t use RDF+ or RDF#, because they’re used. Punctuation naming breaks things.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; ack: gkellogg
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; scribe: pchampin
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> same problem with the JSON-LD WG, when working on JSON-LD 1.1 <br>
... should we go as WHATWG? I don't think so for RDF*
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>TallTed</cite>&gt; "RDF Annotation task force" would put it under the umbrella, without using a version that might be overrun by another group
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> it is more than RDF, a proposal for what a future WG might do
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>gkellogg</cite>&gt; scribe: gkellogg
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> We’re drifting off the action list. I’d like to keep a slot at the end of the meeting for open issues. <br>
... I agree that it might be important for outreach, but we can make progress in parallel.
</p>

<h3 id="item04">SPARQL*</h3>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> I copied over definitions from some old papers into the spec to define query standards. <br>
... What needs to be adjusted is recursion. <br>
... I don’t think there’s anything suprising. I’ve defined it assuming “SA” mode. <br>
... If we have a nested triple and a pattern that my match it, it would not be a match unless the embedded triple is also asserted.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pavel:</cite> I was reading through evaluation semantics. I’m not quite sure how it works with SA mode. If you can’t match an embedded pattern against a database.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> We changed it in the sense that in the original papers, the BIND could match something that was embedded, but that would not be a triple itself in the graph. <br>
... That was possible in the original definitions, but now the triple needs to be explicitly in the graph.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pavel:</cite> If you have BIND and an embedded pattern with variables that iss not in the graph, you can’t use BIND to create embedded triples.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pavel</cite>&gt; bind(&lt;&lt; :a :p :b &gt;&gt; as ?var) &lt;-- no match here
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> This is a separate issue to be discussed. I’ve created another issue to address differences between SA and PG mode, as it’s different. <br>
... You can’t create new triples that aren’t in the graph. <br>
... AndyS suggested renaming BIND to FIND accordingly. But, it’s still open if it matches triples in the graph or embedded triples. <br>
... Issue #6. We’re not talking about issue #8. <br>
... We can discuss #6 next week.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> Using BIND in this way also … If triples are terms they can also be used in expressions. <br>
... You might need to replicate the expression with and without to handle both modes. <br>
... You should be able to ask what the subject of the value of a variable is
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> Are you talking about additional builtin functions?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> By deciding one particular way, we might end up blocking that.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> Getting to issue #6, I like renaming BIND to FIND.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> I just wanted to make clear that there are other consequnces of the decision.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pavel</cite>&gt; fwiw, Stardog does provide additional builtin functions e.g. subject(), to decompose embedded triples
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> We need to put issue #6 on the agenda for next time.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>gatemezing</cite>&gt; Happy also to use another keyword like FIND
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> Can we have a straw poll?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; FWIW so does Jena including construction triple-terms
</p>

<p class='irc'>

<strong class='resolution' id="resolution01">RESOLUTION: close issue #8, the current state of section 4 SPARQL* is satisfying</strong>
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> As AndyS said, just because we’ve resolved an issue, doesn’t mean we can’t come back to discuss it. We’re not a WG, but we’re mimmicking the process.
</p>

<h3 id="item05">annotation syntax</h3>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>TallTed</cite>&gt; trying to extend *all* of RDF, Turtle, N3, N4, SPARQL, TriG, etc. in one whack is a rather large undertaking, given that each of those has had its own WG for updates
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; <a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/pull/58">https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/pull/58</a>
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>olaf</cite>&gt; Preview with diff: <a href="https://pr-preview.s3.amazonaws.com/w3c/rdf-star/58/2160503...7479002.html#turtle-star-grammar">https://pr-preview.s3.amazonaws.com/w3c/rdf-star/58/2160503...7479002.html#turtle-star-grammar</a>
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> This is an extension of Turtle* that’s been discussed for a while. Some people use it in discussions, but it’s not properly documented. It would be useful to have in the document. <br>
... It’s not just about the syntax, but can help us to move forward on SA vs. PG. <br>
... The question is if an embedded triple is also asserted. There have been different interpretations of &lt;&lt; … &gt;&gt;. The idea is to have two different syntaxes, one which asserts, and one which doesn’t That way, we don’t need different modes. <br>
... I think getting rid of SA and PG modes would help discussions. <br>
... That’s why I added a non-normative paragraph to explain the history.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; scribe: pchampin
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> I have implemented it, it is straighforward <br>
... I think we should get rid of PG mode <br>
... a provisional N-Triple* would not have the annotation syntax, only the poiny bracket syntax <br>
... thus you would need to explicitly assert a triple that is also embedded
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; +1 to gkellogg -- "one line, one triple"-ish.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>gkellogg</cite>&gt; scribe: gkellogg
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>thomas</cite>&gt; so only Turtle* would get the sytactic sugar of PG mode?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Is anyone unhappy with the notion of having an annotation syntax? <br>
... To answer thomas, not just Turtle*, but perhaps TriG*, SPARQL*. <br>
... But, N-Triples and N-Quads want to keep one asserted triple per line, which is why they wouldn’t have an annotation syntax.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>thomas</cite>&gt; okay, thanks. +1 to that
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Basically, one “asserted” triple per line.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>TallTed</cite>&gt; I'm not sure I see a strong utility of the annotation syntax, but I don't (yet) see a strong argument against allowing it. Implementation may be problematic, but I can't speak to that at this point.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> This may be a minority view, but as implicit in my use case, I’m opposed to anything that changes the elementary syntax. It runs against the general intent of RDF. <br>
... I believe this should be a consequence of iinterpretation and not of encoding. <br>
... I don’t think there should be two different encodings.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>ora</cite>&gt; Clarify "encoding"
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> The standard does specify how you interpret the syntax.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> N-Triples encodes triples, which are all in graphs. Anything else is going out on thin ice. I can’t see a purpose to ratifying different interpretation of the syntax.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Are you saying you just want PG mode?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> I don’t want a mode at all.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; I'm confused.  It seems to me that this proposal is requiring that :a :b "&lt;a b c&gt;" requires that the triple (a, b, c) be in the graph.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Jerven</cite>&gt; Sorry for the noise, I need to go already
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>TallTed:</cite> I think you’re saying that the interpretation is modal, because you want to have one interpretation for embedded triples, and wheither it’s treated as its own term or another triples.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> I’m not asserting that there are modes, or there may be three modes, but it should be after the fact and not as a consequence of the encoding.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; Isn't this like entailment? Specifically D-entailment -- entailment being an external mechanism.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> It could be that SA and PG are the interpretations, but I don’t want to presume them.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> I agree with AndyS, perhaps this relates more to entailment?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> That would be a way to frame it.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> I see that SA mode is less committing of the two modes.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> The eproblem of saying SA mode is that there is no PG mode. I’d like to avoid that. <br>
... My feeling is that both have reasonable use cases.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> The idea is that the need for PG mode was a problem of redundancy, because SA mode is more redundant. <br>
... Maybe, in other cases, it could be a matter of inferrence.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>TallTed:</cite> I want to be able to say “Mary said Bob is stupid”, but I don’t want to say “Bob is stupid”. <br>
... They can interpret my notation as if it’s asserting it, because it may come around to say something I didn’t mean to say.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> To be clear, is the annotation syntax a problem?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>TallTed:</cite> I don’t see a problem with the syntax, but it may not be easy to implement.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> To james, the problem is that “mode” puts things as either/or, which was useful at the time, but if we have a system where we have a fundamental rule to unify them…
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> The concern I have with mode is that it is exclusive.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; scribe: pchampin
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> my interpretation of this discussion is to get rid of the notion of mode <br>
... everyone would interpret the syntax the same way <br>
... the notion of modes was useful before, because we didn't have the appropriate syntax <br>
... any further matter of interpretation may be a matter of entailment
