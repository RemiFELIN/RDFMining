<h3 id="item02">N-Triples*: call for volunteers</h3>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> no spec test for N-Triples* <br>
... however, we are using this syntax already in the test suites <br>
... anyone interested in writing/drafting this part of the spec? <br>
... please chime in on the github issue <br>
... shouldn't be too difficult to write that
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; ack: gkellogg
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> the parsing may be more difficult b/c it has to recursive <br>
... gkellogg: can write it <br>
... don't think the recursion makes it difficult <br>
... what will be harder will be to extend this for quads

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> there is already something about triple construction

<h3 id="item03">Continue last week's interrupted discussion on Syntactic Sugar / Mime types</h3>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> discussion last week started about syntactic sguar <br>
... then it moved on to mime types <br>
... (do we need to extend them / new ones) <br>
... any more comments on this now?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>ora:</cite> want to confirm, is there an impliciation that there may be docs that are Turtle* but <br>
... do not use any of the new RDF* features?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> yes
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> does not work
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>ora:</cite> ACCEPT header may come into play in a client-server setting?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> yes, but then the server has to change its current behavior <br>
... whole result needs to be inspected before responding to ACCEPT <br>
... tried to find definitive text on mime types <br>
... couldn't find <br>
... some examples in which the syntax has changed but the mime type did not <br>
... XML <br>
... it's difficult to change mime types <br>
... old counterexample is Turtle itself
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>ora</cite>&gt; (Unfortunately I have to drop. Bummer, interesting conversation.) :-(
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> and SPARQL <br>
... for these no change of mime type but the specs changed/evolved
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> raised examples of HTML and ?? <br>
... it would be an exception to make an incompatible change and then change the mime type
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; HTML is not a good example IMO, because browser have a history of "accepting" invalid HTML anyway
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> we are not authorized the spec for Turtle <br>
... so, reference for text/turtle would still be to the Turtle doc <br>
... proposal to extend the mime type <br>
... difficult to find examples of groups who have done something like this
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> would take Turtle and NTriples as example <br>
... if a client says it understand Turtle <br>
... would not return something that the client cannot understand
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> danger of locking out old clients
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> how was the transition for SPARQL?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> took years to happen <br>
... for SPARQL 1.1, SPARQL 1.0 works <br>
... still systems out there that only speak RDF 1.0 <br>
... semantics are different <br>
... different triples may come out by parsing the same doc
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> to james' concern, I agree <br>
... not comfortable for the server to break the contrast <br>
... contract <br>
... but maybe we are overinterpreting mime type as a strong contract
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> how else to interpret it? <br>
... 500 error should be return
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> a robust client should read the whole doc in <br>
... before passing it on to the application software
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> okay, but what's the effect of this on the contract?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> our group cannot change the mimetype
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> if you have a process in which the client has given ACCEPT with SPARQL with SELECT <br>
... but then sends a CONSTRUCT query
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> correct answer is you do not have to respect ACCEPT field <br>
... server may still send back something in a different format <br>
... no evidence in the doc about mimetypes that a change of the mimetypes is necessary <br>
... what about */*?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> in this case, the server can elect
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> but then the server has to cache the whole response to figure out the media type before responding
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> agrees with greg's suggestion to have a profile
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> but then the client has to be aware <br>
... that the profile may break the content
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> cannot do that because profiles are subset not supersets <br>
... instead , parameter is needed
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> requiring a parameter is a way to solve james' concern
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> parameters are not part of the registration <br>
... profiles are
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; STRAWPOLL: keep the old content-types, but augment them with a profile or parameter to make it explicit that the content MAY contain RDF*-specific features
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; +1

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; "MAY augment"

&lt;<cite>TallTed</cite>&gt; +0.5  seems like the minimum possible
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; +0
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> as long as this is just a CG, I feel bad about changing Turtle and not being explicit about it <br>
... publishing something as Turtle but that is not actually (pure) Turtle is not a good idea
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>TallTed</cite>&gt; all old Turtle is also new Turtle-star, but some new Turtle-star is not also old Turtle
</p>

<h3 id="item04">Discuss the new semantics proposal</h3>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> things are moving on the front of the new proposed semantics <br>
... it build on the RDF semantics <br>
... in current proposal the semantic of embedded triples is rigid and close to literals <br>
... difference between literals and IRIs is that literals are constraint to mean the same in all possible interpretations <br>
... their meaning is defined by the datatype <br>
... embedded triples in the current semantics are a bit like that <br>
... i.e., their meaning is the same in all possible interpretation <br>
... their meaning is essentially the triples themselves <br>
... Are we okay with embedded triples acting as something like a literal?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>thomas</cite>&gt; is this a strawpoll?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> discomfort with triples as literals is that <br>
... this adds lots of additional machinary that's not necessary
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> understands the reluctance to add machinery <br>
... to be clear, it's not a datatype
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> in contrast, there is a new datatype
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> but this datatype is not for triples
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> it is a hidden datatype <br>
... and hidden predicates
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> if we didn't want to have bnodes inside embedded triples, <br>
... (i.e., only ground emb. triples), then <br>
... things would be much easier. <br>
... however, the emb.triples have an internal structure <br>
... that we want to preserve in some wa&lt; <br>
... way
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> yet, is this extra stuff necessary?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> what cannot be ensured otherwise is that <br>
... emb.triples with different, say, subject are different things.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> where is that in the things that are written down? <br>
... have to stop adding desiderata at some point
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> just trying to explain <br>
... didn't want to sound like it must be like that
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; STRAWPOLL: should &lt;&lt; :s :p :o &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; :s2 :p :o &gt;&gt; always denote different things?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> question to others ...strawpoll
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> do not understand the question
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; FYI: Stardog has an opinion in this area.
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>james</cite>&gt; do :s and :s2 denote different things
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; If they always do, then how can extensions make them the same thing if :s and :s2 are the same?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> problem with the semantics, it is so specific <br>
... specific to special problem
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Zakim</cite>&gt; TallTed, you wanted to say Embedded-triples-as-subjects can't be simple literals, because literals aren't allowed as subjects in RDF. At minimum, they have to be treated as
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> it's not for the use cases that people will use it for
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>TallTed:</cite> emb.triples cannot be literals <br>
... would have to be treated as synt.sugar for single-triple named graphs <br>
... and special treatment needed because things may not be meant to be asserted
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> reification is just one way to go about adding statements about statements
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> there were very long discussions about reification in the RDF WG
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> we can have a different semantics for embedded triples <br>
... how to get from the ref.opacity to ref.transparency <br>
... why go from a mainstream semantics to a specific one?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> why don't you go to standard reification if you want ref.transparency?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> the proposed semantic have nothing to do with reification
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>TallTed</cite>&gt; There seem to be conflicting beliefs about what "everyone" wants to get from RDF-star.  It might be worthwhile to open a large-scale poll on just that -- is it somehow easier/better reification/annotation; is it a bridge between RDF Graphs and Property Graphs; is it something else?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>thomas:</cite> doesn't make sense as a general solution
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> thanks for the lively discussion
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; It is possible to get referential opacity by adding extra properties to standard reification.  Then RDF* is just sugar for five (or so) triples.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> better understand the arguments of people
