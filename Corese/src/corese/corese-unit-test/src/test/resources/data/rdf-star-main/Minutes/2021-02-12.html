<h3 id="item01">pending actions</h3>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin1</cite>&gt; <a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaction">https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaction</a>
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin1:</cite> we have to discuss on the pending actions <br>
... on more work on SPARQL* and s/rdf*/rdf-star <br>
... missing to do the same for the use case documents. We also have to rename them in the UC docs
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> AndyS can you work on those changes?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; AndyS: yes
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> will assign an action to AndyS to help for the record
</p>

<h3 id="item02">Discuss the new PR for semantics</h3>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Next topic - discussing the semantics
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>scribe</cite>&gt; chair: pchampin
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> We have to solve some concerns regarding the semantics and if it can be added in the public draft <br>
... Great summary by pfps on the mailing list on the current state of the affairs. see pfps message
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-star/2021Feb/0039.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-star/2021Feb/0039.html</a>
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> asking pfps if he can summarize his points for non technical people here
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> Tried to find out the differences in the current proposals in the maling list and PRs on github <br>
... only 3 of the 4 seem more important. <br>
... A difference is one you generate RDF graph, do you do something special? <br>
... The other importance is whether you use a hidden vocabulary o can't be assess except by using RDF-star <br>
... If a scheme depends on the embedded semantics, there might be some issues.. <br>
... Differences can occur when merging before/after two RDF-star graphs <br>
... The question is whether an embedded triple with illed form litteral is clearly stated or not?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> I agree that special datatype is a detail, and it could be done without.. <br>
... Also agree that cornor case can be adapted in the proposal
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; SELECT * { ?x rdf:subject ?y }
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Do we expect RDF-star to retrieve embedded triples for that query?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; If the RDF* vocabulary is not hidden, then the SPARQL(*) query above will return something in the presence of embedded triples.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> There are specific rdf terms...
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; And "SELECT * { ?s ?p ?o }" and similarly count queries.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> The hidden vocab will allow systems to be more flexible
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>gkellogg</cite>&gt; Ruby RDF also uses a special term for an RDF triple (RDF::Statement).
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> I'm in favour of hidden vocabularies and not see any convincing arguments to introduce specific URIs. <br>
... Are they any arguments for that introduction?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> It is to come up with variations of RDF-star and transparent embedded triples <br>
... even though RDF-star are mostly (semi) transparent
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; SELECT * { ?s ?p ?o }
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; Ah, yes,  that's an issue.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Maybe have 2 levels of compliance
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; I'm not in favour of "splitting" implementation.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> implementations that can operate also at level of interoperability/exchange
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> There's no reason that an implementation would have to create it separetly <br>
... if you have a syntatic distinction, then you can do that. But if it's on the term, then it's more complicated
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>Zakim</cite>&gt; AndyS, you wanted to note a consequence of triples with real vocab.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>AndyS:</cite> One of the consequence, it's that it could be partial... <br>
... one of the possibility is to define a mapping from RDF triple terms into say reification <br>
... adding an extra term was not an easy way of going
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> I saw that pfps is not in favor of splitting the implementations <br>
... The goal is to give flexibility to get things done in one way or another
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; AndyS: A new RDF term was not as problematic as dealing with reification quads (which can be partial AKA broken).
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; STRAWPOLL: 2 levels of compliance
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>olaf</cite>&gt; -1
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> What about having 2 levels of compliance
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; -0.7
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>gkellogg</cite>&gt; -1
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; 0 (not sure I fully grok the details)
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; +0
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>twomas</cite>&gt; 42

<p class='phone'>
+0
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>TallTed</cite>&gt; -0.5 (also not sure I fully grok, but to the extent I do, it doesn't seem a good path)
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> It would introduce for mapping from RDF to RDF-star graph? IMHO, I don't think so <br>
... If we really consider as a mean to define semantics, we need to avoid complications by having 2 compliance levels
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; But aren't all RDF* and SPARQL* implementations non-conformant to every published description of RDF* and SPARQL*?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> understanding RDF-star is not really 2 level of compliance
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> There is no much tractions for the idea
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>AndyS</cite>&gt; pfps - Blazegraph?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> The original semantics of SPARQL-star was a mapping to RDF?
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pfps</cite>&gt; The original paper has two semantics, and they diverge.  Implementations appear to implement the direct semantics, not the indirect one.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> We have discussed a lot the hidden vocabulary, but not if we want to keep the abstract syntax and define a mapping ?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pfps:</cite> yes. Remember it was an answer to different ways to create RDF-star <br>
... we should have to figure out this thing is supposed to work <br>
... it seems like we don't have a common understanding how RDF-star should work.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> we really need a huge rework of everything including SPARQL-star... <br>
... the abstract syntax is something we did not argue a lot here <br>
... I would like to hear others
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> I agree with pierre. <br>
... I would claim for implementers to give them a big picture of what should come out when querying RDF-star
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> Are we ready to deal without abstract semantics? <br>
... seem no strong opinion
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>james:</cite> I do agree with olaf that the semantics should be based on the abstract syntax. <br>
... it should not prevent the editors to stop the publication
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> put something in the doc so that people can respond
</p>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>pchampin</cite>&gt; PROPOSAL: include PR88  in the first public draftbefore publishing, with a link to an issue summarizing Peter's email about the altnatives

</p>

<h3 id="item03">publishing first draft</h3>

<p class='irc'>
&lt;<cite>olaf</cite>&gt; Given that we have a few mins left, can we do a strawpoll on the question of whether we want to keep the abstract syntax?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> I found no way to make links to previous draft <br>
... having the links in the header generated by respec. It seems to work for WG.
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> It is manually done
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> We have 5 minutes left. What are the best way to have more attractions? <br>
... We have something in the community blog <br>
... Any other ideas? <br>
... The semantic web mailing list as well
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> Also something in the CG, the RDF list and pchampin to give a talk <br>
... in the next month or so...
</p>

<p class='phone'>
+1 to also present a summary in some events by the chairs
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>gkellogg:</cite> We are finishing the work in the JSON-LD  CG in one or 2 weeks
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> anyhing else?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
Zamik, who is present?

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> thank you very much. We made some progress and congrats for the next coming first public draft
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> I would like to add the contributions in the draft
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> how do we suggest we proceed?
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>olaf:</cite> create an issue and ask everybody. It should be a short term without delaying the draft
</p>

<p class='phone'>
<cite>pchampin:</cite> It should be a short term without delaying the draft
