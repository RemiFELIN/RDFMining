The intuition behind it is to evaluate the credibility of OWL 2 axioms based on the evidence available in the form of a set of facts contained in a chosen RDF dataset. To achieve it, we first define the notions of development, content, support , confirmation and counterexample of an axiom. Then we use these notions to define the possibility and necessity of an axiom and its acceptance/rejection index combining both of them. Finally, we report a practical application of the proposed framework to test SubClassOf axioms against the DBpedia RDF dataset.",

A SHACL validator produces a validation report whose result is false for a shape graph as soon as there is at least one node in the RDF data graph that does not conform to the shape. This Boolean result of the validation of an RDF data graph against an RDF shape graph is not suitable for discovering new high-potential shapes from the RDF data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework to accept shapes with a realistic proportion of nodes in an RDF data graph that does not conform to it. Based on this framework, we propose an extension of the SHACL validation report to express a set of metrics including the generality and likelihood of shapes and we define a method to test a shape as a hypothesis test. Finally, we present the results of experiments conducted to validate a test RDF data graph against a set of shapes.",

In particular, tools dedicated to ontology management are a keystone for semantic Web applications. In this paper we consider a possibilistic framework and an evolutionary approach for ontology enrichment with OWL axioms. The assessment of candidate OWL axioms against an RDF knowledge graph requires a high computational cost, especially in terms of computation time (CPU), which may limit the applicability of the framework. To answer this problem, our contribution presented in this paper consists of (i) a multi-threading system to parallelize axiom assessment, (ii) a heuristic to avoid redundant computation and (iii) an optimization for SPARQL query chunking relying on an extension of the SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query standard. The results of a comparative evaluation show that our proposal significantly outperforms the original algorithm, enabling a significant reduction in computation time.",

To help overcome the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck, we propose a grammar-based genetic programming method for mining OWL class disjointness axioms from the Web of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated by sampling a large RDF dataset for training and testing the discovered axioms on the full dataset. First, we applied Grammatical Evolution to discover axioms based on a random sample of DBpedia, a large open knowledge graph consisting of billions of elementary assertions (RDF triples). Then, the discovered axioms are tested for accuracy on the whole DBpedia. We carried out experiments with different parameter settings and analyze output results as well as suggest extensions.",

The instances, represented by RDF triples, playthe role of specific observations, from which axioms can be extracted bygeneralization. Based on the insight that discovering new knowledge isessentially an evolutionary process, whereby hypotheses are generatedby some heuristic mechanism and then tested against the available evi-dence, so that only the best hypotheses survive, we propose the use ofGrammatical Evolution, one type of evolutionary algorithm, for miningdisjointness OWL 2 axioms from an RDF data repository such as DBpe-dia. For the evaluation of candidate axioms against the DBpedia dataset,we adopt an approach based on possibility theory.",
